Structured protocol for AI-to-AI communication
# AINX-Core

**AINX** (Artificial INteraction eXchange) is a lightweight, structured protocol and agent framework that enables fast, modular, and interpretable AI-to-AI communication.

> "Human language was built for noise. AINX is built for precision."

## ðŸ”§ What is AINX?

AINX is both:
- A protocol: `ROLE::INTENT::OBJECT.key=value` (e.g., `ANALYST::QUERY::SALES.region=EMEA`)
- A framework: For building modular agents that can talk, plan, and evolve together.

## ðŸ“¦ Components

- `protocol.py`: Defines the message grammar and parser.
- `agent.py`: Base agent that can send, receive, and act.
- `engine.py`: Simple message loop for multi-agent simulations.
- `examples/`: See AINX in action.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Create a universal language for AI agent collaboration.
- Support decision-making, task routing, and tool orchestration.
- Be fast, interpretable, and future-proof.
